## Website scraper for watch straps
*Website to be scraped: [www.watch-tools.de][1]*
  
A project just for fun to scrape the [website][1] and gather data about different watch straps.  
Afterwards creating an API to make that data available for an user with filters and search criteria.  
  
This will be realized in python, the framework [*scrapy*][2] for the web scraping and [*fastapi*][3] to create the API for it.

After some random browsing through the web I came across [*streamlit*][4] and decided to build a small website with the result we got from scraping.
